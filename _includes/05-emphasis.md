I worked on a project called **CodeINN** which is an _instant code editor_, that makes programming and development easier. Practice quickly and directly from your web browser, without any setup needed. CodeINN gives the perfect environment to developers, coders, and geeks to do more with their tech.

### Features

- Single Platform for web development, programming, and markdown, without the need for constantly switching tools
- **live preview** of the code changes
- _Syntax highlighting, bracket matching, code formatting, and autocompletion_
